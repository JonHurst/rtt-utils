    <h1>Overall structure</h1>

    <p>A reference text transformation (RTT) of a work consists of
    scans of all relevant pages of that work (blank pages are
    removed), a file containing a UTF-8 text representation for each
    of those scans and an XML file providing structure, formatting
    information and metadata.</p>

    <h1>Text file conventions</h1>

    <h2>Character set</h2>

    <p>The character set used is UTF-8.</p>

    <h2>Line synchronisation</h2>

    <p>The lines of the text are synchronised to the lines of the
    scan, i.e. characters appearing on the same line in a scan appear
    on the same line in the associated text file, and the lines
    themselves appear in the same order. The exception is where a soft
    hyphen in the scan splits a word over two lines: in this case the
    soft hyphen is removed and the rejoined word placed at the start
    of the lower line.</p>

    <p>DP source material has hyphens and dashes “clothed” on the
    upper line. These are corrected if they result in a mismatch in
    line count. They may also be corrected for other reasons, e.g. to
    prevent excessively long lines, but otherwise they are accepted
    since the benefit in correcting them is not sufficient to justify
    the cost.</p>

    <p>Where there is an obvious error in a scan, that error is
    corrected in the text, and the correction is noted in the XML
    file. Depending on the source material it may not be possible to
    ensure that a note exists for every correction made, but a
    correction without a note is still considered an error, and if an
    errata report is received that notes a difference between scan and
    text that has occurred due to an unnotified correction, a note
    will be added.</p>

    <h2>Separation of blocks</h2>

    <p>Where two successive lines should not be wrapped together they
    are separated with a single blank line. Where this occurs over a page
    boundary, the blank line is inserted at the top of the second
    page.</p>

    <h2>Special characters</h2>

    <p>Nearly all special characters are catered for by the UTF-8
    encoding. Of special note:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The UTF-8 character for ellipse (U2026) is used rather than
      successive periods.</li>
      <li>All hyphens are hard hyphens.</li>
      <li>Number ranges use unspaced en dash (U2013).</li>
      <li>Where a spaced en dash and an unspaced em dash (U2014) are
      typographically equivalent, the spaced en dash is used.</li>
      <li>A 3em dash is represented with three successive em
      dashes.</li>
      <li>Quotes are directional: left single quote (U2018) and right
      single quote (U2019) for single quotes, left doule quote (U201C)
      and right double quote (U201D) for double quotes. A single right
      quote is used for apostrophe as suggested in the unicode
      spec. Double prime (U2033) is used for double prime, ditto,
      seconds and inches. Single prime is (U2032) is used for single
      prime, minutes and feet. Straight quotes are never used.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Material in scan not included in text</h2>

    <p>Page furniture such as running headers/footers, page numbers,
    catchwords etc. are not included. The XML has the Facility to
    capture original page numbers if desired.</p>

    <h2>Microformatting</h2>

    <p>Microformatting is text in the scan that is represented in a
    different way to the rest of the text in its block. Common
    examples are words highlighted in italics, bolding, underlining or
    small caps in blocks of normal text. The XML file defines strings
    to represent the opening and closing of a region of
    microformatting. To avoid ambiguity, these strings must be chosen
    such that they do not appear elsewhere in the text. The usual
    choices are {{ and }}.</p>

    <h1>XML file conventions</h1>

    <h2>Schema</h2>

    <p>There is a <a href="#">RelaxNG schema</a> available for the XML
    file.</p>

    <h2>Text</h2>

    <p>The text element includes the text using an XInclude
    directive. This allows easy XSL processing while at the same time
    meaning that work can be carried out on the text with tools such
    as sed and grep without reference to the XML file.</p>

    <h2>Tags</h2>

    <p>Each page can have any number of tag sets, each with its own
    class name. Each tag set consists of any number of tags. There is
    no mandate on how these tags should be used.</p>

    <p>The convention I have use, however, is:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>If there is microformatting on the page, a tag set with
      "inline_formatting" class is added. The tags uses are "italics",
      "bold", "small_caps", "gesperrt", "superscript", "subscript" and
      "misc_inline". This allows automatic processing of
      microformatting on any page that only has one type.</li>

      <li>If there are any macroformatting items that will a tag set
      with a class of "block_formatting" is added. A "heading" tag is
      added if there is a heading on the page. Other tags are added as
      appropriate. For text derived from DP F2 these are
      "wrap_block", "nowrap_block", "illustration", "footnote",
      "sidenote" and "thought_break".</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Image lines</h2>

    <p>The image element can optionally include a lines element. This
    is a comma separated list of the positions of the lines in the
    image in ten-thousandths of image height.</p>

    <h2>Notes</h2>

    <p>Both the book element and each page element can contain a notes
    element. Each notes element contains one or more note
    elements. One use for these is noting where an error in the scan has
    been corrected in the text.</p>
